## Bio

I'm an MS student at the [Center for Systems Integration & Sustainability](https://www.canr.msu.edu/csis/) at Michigan State University interested in using satellite data to measure changes in environmental systems. 
  
Currently, I study the interconnected effects of natural disasters across the globe using the [metacoupling framework](https://www.canr.msu.edu/telecoupling/metacoupling/#:~:text=The%20telecoupling%20framework%20allows%20researchers%20to%20build%20models,fisheries%20management%2C%20biodiversity%20conservation%2C%20land%20use%20and%20more.). 
  
I was previously a member of the [Assal Biogeography & Landscape Dynamics Lab](https://assallab.org/) at Kent State University where I started my journey through earth & environmental data science.
